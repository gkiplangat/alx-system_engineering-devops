**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage on November 12, 2023**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** 3 hours (15:00 - 18:00 UTC)
- **Impact:** The user authentication service experienced a complete outage, affecting 30% of users who were unable to log in or access secured resources.

**Timeline:**
- **15:00 UTC:** Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in authentication failures.
- **15:05 UTC:** Investigation initiated to identify the root cause.
- **15:20 UTC:** Initial assumption of a database failure due to increased load. Database team engaged for further analysis.
- **15:45 UTC:** Misleading investigation into recent code deployments as a potential cause, leading to a temporary rollback.
- **16:30 UTC:** No improvement observed. Issue escalated to senior backend engineers and DevOps for a deeper investigation.
- **17:00 UTC:** Rediscovered monitoring logs revealing unusual API requests causing a cascading failure in user authentication.
- **17:30 UTC:** Incident escalated to security team due to suspicion of a potential cyber attack.
- **18:00 UTC:** Root cause identified as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack targeting the authentication service.
  
**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Cause:** The DDoS attack overwhelmed the authentication service with a high volume of malicious requests, leading to service degradation.
- **Resolution:** Implemented rate limiting on incoming API requests, applied IP blacklisting for identified malicious sources, and scaled up server resources to handle increased load during an ongoing attack. Additionally, engaged with DDoS protection service for proactive measures.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Strengthen DDoS mitigation measures by implementing a more robust traffic filtering solution.
  - Enhance monitoring alerts to include anomaly detection for sudden spikes in authentication failures.
  - Conduct regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors.

- **Tasks:**
  1. Deploy and configure enhanced DDoS protection mechanisms.
  2. Update and test incident response protocols to include DDoS scenarios.
  3. Conduct a thorough review of current monitoring tools and metrics for better anomaly detection.
  4. Collaborate with the security team to establish a more resilient authentication service architecture.
  5. Schedule regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion:**
The web stack outage on November 12, 2023, was a result of a DDoS attack targeting the user authentication service. The timely detection, collaborative investigation, and swift action taken by the cross-functional teams helped in resolving the issue within three hours. Moving forward, the implementation of enhanced DDoS protection measures, improved monitoring, and regular security audits will fortify the system against potential threats, ensuring a more resilient and secure web stack.
